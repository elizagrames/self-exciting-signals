# Self-exciting point process models for acoustic signals
Data and code to reproduce analyses from Grames et al. (2022). Separating acoustic signal into underlying behaviors with self-exciting point process models. Ecological Modelling. 

Note that the example model output file is rather large and is archived separately on Zenodo along with v1.0 of the data and code contained here. For model outputs from all samples presented in the paper (~32 Gb), not just the example, please contact Eliza Grames at egrames@unr.edu.
